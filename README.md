# Recommender-System-with-Neural-Networks

##  NeuralRecoNet — Neural Network–Powered Recommender System.

> **"Building intelligent, data-driven recommendation engines using deep learning architectures like Autoencoders, RNNs, and Graph Neural Networks."**

**NeuralRecoNet** is an advanced **neural network–based recommender system** designed to deliver **personalized user-item recommendations** using deep learning.  
It combines **representation learning**, **sequence modeling**, and **graph-based reasoning** to uncover complex relationships in user behavior and preferences — going beyond traditional collaborative filtering.

##  Overview

Most recommender systems rely on static similarity metrics or matrix factorization, which fail to capture **non-linear and temporal relationships**.  
**NeuralRecoNet** leverages deep learning to model complex interactions, enabling more **dynamic, context-aware, and accurate recommendations**.

The framework is modular — allowing experimentation with:
-  **Autoencoders** for latent feature learning  
-  **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN / LSTM / GRU)** for sequential recommendation  
-  **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)** for relationship-aware suggestions
