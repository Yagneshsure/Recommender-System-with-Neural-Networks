# NeuralRecoNet
NeuralRecoNet — Hybrid Recommender System combining RNNs and GNNs.

## Overview
This project models both sequential and relational dependencies in user–item interactions
using a combination of RNNs (for sequence modeling) and GNNs (for structural reasoning).

## Features
- RNN-based sequence model
- GNN-based user–item graph model
- Hybrid fusion model
- Modular training/evaluation scripts
- Streamlit/FastAPI-ready for deployment
