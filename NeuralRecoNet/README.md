# NeuralRecoNet
NeuralRecoNet — Deep Learning–Based Hybrid Recommender System

## Overview
NeuralRecoNet combines Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
to model both **sequential** and **relational** patterns in user-item interactions.
It supports modular experimentation, easy training, and real-time deployment.

## Features
- RNN-based sequence modeling (LSTM/GRU)
- GNN-based graph reasoning (LightGCN/GraphSAGE)
- Hybrid architecture (RNN + GNN fusion)
- Modular PyTorch code
- Streamlit/FastAPI deployment ready

## Structure
See `setup_neuralreconet.py` for full directory generation.
